# PhotoFullStack

## What is this?
PhotoFullStack is a photo application which consists of a back-end built in Go and two front-end applications built for Android (using Java) and iOS (using Swift).

The features of the application are displaying, adding and removing a user's photos and login functionality.

## How to use
This will be updated as the project evolves.

## Testing
Unit testing will be used thoroughly for the development of the back-end, where we will be using the Go `testing` package. The front-end applications are a bit harder to test properly, and will be tested and debugged while using the applications.
